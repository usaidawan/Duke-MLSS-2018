In Q-learning, we assume the agent will take the best possible action: $\\max_a Q_\\pi(s_{t+1}, a)$. SARSA, on the other hand, uses the action that was actually taken next in the episode we are learning from: $Q_\\pi(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1})$. In other words, SARSA learns from the next action he actually took (on policy), as opposed to what the max possible Q value for the next state was (off policy).\n",
